work-day-scheduler - Homework assignment for 01/27/2021

---------------------------------------------------------

I started by building the bare bones of my site using HTML and CSS. I kept most of the original design elements, but added a bit of my own taste. I tried to keep things simple this week and focus primarily on the javaScript, as this is where I need the most practice.

I decided to use the moment library to work with dates and times. I first focused on getting the page to display today's date, as well as getting the backgrounds of the text boxes to change dynamically, based on what time it is.

I then got started on adding the text inputs to local storage. I got stuck trying to retrieve the inputs from local storage, but plan on having this fixed by my next tutoring session.
